Some of my favourite quotes:
> The difference between fiction and reality is that fiction has to make sense.

> The universe doesn't really care if its final answers look clean; they are what they are by logical necessity, with no concern over how easily we'll be able to understand them.

> If you are not willing to learn, no one can help you. If you are determined to learn, no one can stop you
