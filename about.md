I'm an second year undergraduate at the [University of New South Wales](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au) studying [Computer Science](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/programs/2022/3778?year=2022). I'm interested in technology, education, and just seeing what's out there.

I'm also an Academic Tutor at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html), where I currently teach two tutorials a week for [INFO1110: Introduction to Programming](/teaching).

I created this site to be able to share my thoughts and document interesting things I come across throughout my studies.
