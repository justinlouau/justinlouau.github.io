## Summary

I recently took part in Accenture's Technology Bootcamp a four day program where we worked in a team alongside mentors from Accenture's technology teams to solve a problem. 

Our group was tasked with researching and presenting a revamp of Accenture's MyWizard Portal, an ageing internal repository of products accessed by consultants and developers to build and sell their services. 

Our team ended up focusing on the design elements of the revamp, with much our time was spent identifing pain points with the current site and drafting new functionality and visual layouts. With guidance from the mentors, we created a Figma prototype and React MVP.

## Retro

At the end of the bootcamp, Jess helped us to conduct a retrospective (retro) to reflect on what we did well, what could have been done better, what has gone wrong, what are hte action items. Generally done by Project Manager after a project is handed over or closed off.

<br>

#### Things we did well

- Lots of information, good at facing unknown
- very good at listening to everyone's opinions; empathetic 
- accepting of new ideas -> one good thing the Jess said she really liked about this team
- really pulled together and went all in on the last day once everything was established and the team had established trust and familiarity
- a lot of us stepped out of our comfort zone in terms of technology and coolaboration

I was bad at thinking of things we did well and seeing the good points, but my team members did - probably something to work on for me as well

<br>

#### What could have done better

- Too many meetings, spent hours on the first day; could have been improved by taking notes
- a lot of tangents on meetings; "lets do this!" -> 2 hours later...
- meetings not as productive as expected; setting a time limit on meetings
- divide meetings up into smaller meetings - limit full team meetings
- identify the purpose of the meeting; should be to decide next steps

- role assignments -> means people have resposability for corresponding tasks and prevents overlap
- very important to streamline coordination and prevent blockers
- hard to overcome due to initial friction with formation of new teams
- don't have to be in a fixed role for each project; may contribute different aspects of your skills in differnet projects
- people felt the worst when they didn't know what their role was and didn't know how to contribute

## Overall Impressions

It was quite interesting to talk with the mentors and learn about how technology teams at Accenture work. One of the more surprising takeaways from one of the senior developers was to be able to think about problems not just from a development perspective, but also a business impact perspective. Crucially, we needed to be able to justify the business impact of our project and be able to quantify it's specific effects on revenue and productivity, which was very different to the usual engineering approach of "how best to solve this problem".

I think my favourite part of the bootcamp was the retro (retrospective), because it was a great chance to see the effects of our work and progress. I also really enjoyed hearing the perspectives of our mentors and others on our teams, since we all had shared and diverging views on different aspects of what we did and didn't do well, which was really interesting. All in all, I felt a lot closer to my team by the end and it definately felt like we had all been through a shared ordeal as all group projects are, albeit this one positive and voluntary.

I also surprisingly enjoyed contributing to the project from more of a project management role. I haven't reeally concidered it before, but I think product management and SCRUM master work also seems pretty cool, which might be something I explore later. It's definately a very interesting application of problem solving and resource management of how to divide work in a way that maximises happiness and also gets the job done. It was unexpectedly fun being on top of everything and having a strong contribution to the direction of the project as opposed to working on the technical details of what framework to use and where a searchbar should be positioned.

In the end, would I work at Accenture? I don't know, maybe early career. I can definately see a lot of the benefits of working at such a large consulting company - getting exposed to a broad range of projects and working many roles on lots of different teams would be super helpful to developing teamwork and time management skills. In the end, I suppose there will always be trade offs for every company, and I'm in a really lucky position to have been able to talk to people in the company and see firsthand what sort of work and culture there is. Luckily, I don't graduate until 2023, so I won't have to make a decision for a while and I can keep exploring and learning. The bootcamp was definately a great experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone else who's thinking of applying.
