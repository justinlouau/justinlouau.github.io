#### ENGG1000 <a name="ENGG1000"></a>

>**Subject Code/Name:** [ENGG1000 Engineering Design and Innovation](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2021/engg1000) - Project eEVee
>
>**Lecturer(s):** Varies based on project

>**Difficulty:** 1/5

>**Overall Rating:** 1/5

**Comments:**

For my ENGG1000 project, I was assigned to Project eEVee (Evolving Electric Vehicles for Emerging Economies), a chemical engineering project focused around designing an effective battery to drive a lego car. This project requires that you supply your own PPE (Lab Coat, Safety Goggles, Face Mask) to be able to work in the chemical engineering labs. 

While this project says that no prior knowledge is necessary, you're basically screwed if you haven't taken HSC Chemistry. The course offers technical lectures on electrochemistry but it's really not enough to facilitate more advanced cell designs to get good marks. Similarly, very little support was given for the car design and concepts like torque, current, and gear ratios are never taught directly. I felt that I learnt more from my group members than from the teaching staff, which is a problem when you consider the massive disparities in skillsets between groups. 

Overall, I think this would be a fun course if you were adequately prepared and had the background knowledge to work systematically and effectively. As it is now, it feels like you're being thrown headfirst into a project with little to no support, with your success being entirely determined by the team you're assigned. With only 6 effective weeks to work on the project, it was difficult to do anything meaningful and to develop the technical knowledge needed before actually starting work. 

I also dislike the assessment format, with things like structured reflections feeling very forced in that questions are specifically written to direct you towards certain insights to get marks. In the end, you do get exposure to lots of different areas of engineering (at least in this project) but I personally think that the course seems like a massive waste of time, and that these skills could be much more effectively gained outside of the classroom.

**Comments:**

I thought that this was a difficult but fair course. The staff were very understanding of the fact that this was one of the first university courses that many of us were taking and the delivery of the course and assessments online was well refined after a year of online learning. However, the technology behind the course (Maple TA / Maple) is quite antiquated, and very prone to crashing so there were frequent extensions when Maple when inevitable crash close to a deadline when load was high. The final exam ended up crashing, which led to a lot of memes and chaos as the course staff scrambled 

In terms of lectures, I quite enjoyed the algebra lectures - they introduced difficult content in an understandable manner and there was  obviously put in a lot of effort to make things fun and interactive despite lectures being in a virtual format. Unfortunately, I had a lot of difficulty following the calculus lectures and I often opted to read directly from the course notes or the Maple TA quizzes. 

Content is quite crammed, and goes from easy to wtf quite quickly. Despite the difficulty of the course, I chose to give it a 4/5 because of how well it was organised and the the design of the course such that content is easy to learn but hard to master, which is also reflected in the layout of assessments.

**Comments:**

MATH1231 is essentially a continuation of the content in MATH1131, and so much of what I said in my MATH1131 review also applies here.

**Comments:**

Quite an interesting course which looks at logic and concepts such as permutations/combinations and modulo that are really useful for computing. I found it pretty hard and abstract at times, but Daniel is a great lecturer who makes the concepts quite grounded and brings in other interesting fields like anchient babylonean numbers.

>**Overall Rating:** 4/5

**Comments:**

Great course, Hayden is a very good lecturer who has a way of breaking down hard concepts into more understandable ones. This course is very fundamental to computing, and starts to get you to think about the speed and performance of your programs, and well as giving you more advanced tools in the form of data structures to do some pretty cool and funky stuff like solve mazes. I really enjoyed the assignments, with the first assignment being a perforance focused one where you tuned your program to minimise it's runtime and the second one being a graph based on to test your understanding of implementing and using data structures. The final sections of assignment 2 got pretty crazy, but it was still a very fun a great course overall. Would recommend.

>**Difficulty:** 1/5

>**Overall Rating:** 5/5

**Comments:**

This was a very well put together and interesting course, which really achieved it's goals of getting me to "think like an economist". Isabella and Alberto were really wholesome and friendly lecturers, and really elevated the course experience as a whole. Rachael was also really amazing as the tutor, and I believe she's doing associate lecturing now so would definately recommend taking the course when any of them are teaching. Having any one of them would be a treat, so having all three made this one of my favourite courses I've taken at UNSW. The course content itself is also extremely useful, and I use concepts like opportunity cost every day now, not to mention how fun the course is - for example, game theory was one of my favourite parts, where we learned to model real world problem to scenarios like prisoners dillema, such as two companies choosing whether to undercut each other to make a profit and analysing pay off matrixes of cooperation in the short term and long term. I'm planning to do some further self study into economics because of this course, and am actually finding it fun.

**Comments:**

This was a well designed and structured course, which follows on very logically from COMP2521 and COMP1521, so being familar with systems programming and data structures is essential. This course answered a lot of questions I had about how operating systems work and what actually happens under the hood when you open a file or call a functions, and required a lot of creative thinking to design elegant data structures and ADTs. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed COMP2521 or COMP1521, and to anyone with an interest in how an operating system actually works from a practical perspective. The only part I disliked about the course was the final exam, which was a theory exam on Moodle and which I didn't feel was particularly well structured. However, the course as a whole is still great and I would highly recommend it.

>**Lecturer(s):** Raveen de Silva

>**Difficulty:** 4.5/5

>**Overall Rating:** 3/5

**Comments:**

This is a math course disguised as a comp course, which I would recommend taking later in your degree if possible. While the course doesn't have many formal prerequisites, I think that having some more mathmatical maturity beyond MATH1081 will help greatly with the problem solving aspects of this course. Being familiar with proofs, data structures, and time complexity is highly recommended, and having a good deal of mathematical/computing maturity will also help greatly. There's no coding, so problem solving is the core focus of this course. 

I found Raveen's style of lecturing quite dry and mathematical, and I personally found it hard to follow along, so I often opted to learn in other ways. The MIT introduction to algorithms course follows this course quite closely, so I would often skim the slides and supplement content from there.

For me, the peer tutorials were the most useful part of the course, and I would recommend attending as many as you can. While I come into the course fairly ill prepared, I found that being able to discuss problems with tutors and other students really helped with my problem solving skills, and made a lot more sense to me when I was actually whiteboarding and designing algorithms hands on. 

While I picked up a few tricks in algorithm design, developing my understanding of how algorithms fit into the broader context of computer science and gaining exposure to the more theoretical computer science courses was by far the most useful part of the course for me. Problems like P = NP underpin the field of computer science, and taking this course opened up concepts like finite autometa, intractability, and correctness/verification, which has sparked my interest in looking more into theoretical computer science. 

While I found this as a very hard to approach course, it's very good at developing your problem solving skills and I know I gained a lot from taking it.
