#### Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future<a name="elonmusk"></a>

**Comments:**

I enjoyed this book because I felt it read a bit like a history book with a bit of a focus on a fairly prominent figure, and gives some insight into the context and culture of technology in America in recent times. Since the book is focused around Musk and his companies, it touches on electric vehicles, space exploration, and some early entrepreneurship. Despite being a biography, it didn't feel overly hagiographical and I think gave a fairly grounded insight into the all topics mentioned. Would recommend for anyone interested in the context of how Tesla and SpaceX were founded and the technologies Musk is involved in.

#### Atomic Habits<a name="atomichabits"></a>

**Comments:**

I quite enjoyed Atomic Habits because I felt it was fundamentally a book about designing good systems, and because it was quite an easy read with lots of case studies and stories interwoven throughout. While you should never trust a book entirely, I think there are a lot of interesting insights in Atomic Habits that make it worth reading, even if you don't agree with everything it says.

#### Who Gets What and Why: Economics of Matchmaking and Market Design <a name="whogetswhat"></a>

**Comments:**

This is a really interesting book which looks at "matching markets", things like jobs, education, and dating, which don't have a price and don't fit into a normal demand and supply market. It's super in depth and I think gives a great perspective on how to design preference systems for things like UAC offers or school preferences, as well as the issues you can face with things like unravelling and exploding offers when dealing with job offers. 

It also touches on the design of many other markets like ecommerce, advertising, as well as High Frequency Trading. At the same time, there's plenty of useful economic theory on auction and market design while not sounding like a textbook. It also goes a bit into the ethics, and things like kidney exchanges and donations in the context of how one would design a market keeping in mind ethical and moral dillemas.
