#### Privasec!

I've been taking part in the Privasec Hackcelerator Program for the past 12 weeks, attending talks and getting hands on with projects and labs, all in the name of becoming a leet hacker. It's been great fun, and an amazing experience to get to see what real life hackers do in the day to day.

There were two streams for this program this year - RED and GRC. I applied for the RED stream, which focused on penetration testing and red teaming and was the more "technical" of the two streams. On top of the mentoring we got from the weekly sessions, we were able to try out both a malware security project and a web security project to get a taste of the field.

As the final stage of the program, we had chance to present a 10 minute presentation to the other mentees and mentors.
