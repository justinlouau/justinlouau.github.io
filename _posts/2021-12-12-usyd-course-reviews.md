**Comments:**

INFO1110 teaches programming using Python, and is structured to be broadly applicable as both an elective course for non-computing students and as a core course for computing ones. It's very difficult to have an introductory course which caters to such a wide audience, and I feel that this course been a decent compromise concidering everything it needs to do.

One important thing to note is that this course is run as an introduction to programming course, and not an introduction to Python course. USYD has always been a bit more on the theoretical side, and so the course has a focus on teaching good programming principles like style, modularity, and testing as opposed to developing programming ability or low level skills.

As a whole, I would recommend this course as an elective if you're interested in learning programming in a structured environment. Otherwise, you should concider self learning or taking the advanced version of this course.

**Comments:**

While I haven't taken this subject personally, this unit has traditionally run alongside INFO1110, so I have had exposure to the teaching materials and assignments as a tutor. 

As an advanced course, you'll either need to be an advanced or scholarship student (eg. Dayell Scholar) or need to apply for special permission to enrol. Usually this is through a fairly short and straitforward entrance exam, which you should be able to pass if you have had any programming experience before.

My impression of this course is that it's definately an advanced course which has a higher level of difficulty and a much higher time commitment to be able to do well. The course is initially taught in C, and draws a lot of concepts from second year computing courses which makes it suitable for anyone interested in computing as a career or is curious about the low level details about how a computer works. The later parts of the course converge, so you'll cover the same content as INFO1110 regarding classes and Python programming. 

You'll learn a lot if you take this course, and you'll be very well setup for any further study in computing or software degree whereas INFO1110 is more geared as an elective course. However, you should weight up the time and WAM tradeoffs from taking the more advanced version.
