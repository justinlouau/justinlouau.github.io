[MIT: How to Speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY)

Purpose: start with what your goal is and what people are going to learn

Cycling: key concepts should be introduced 3 times

Pauses: 7 seconds pause when asking questions

Blackboards/whiteboards
- Useful for instructing - lecturing, teaching, etc
- good as it forces you to slow down - the speed at which you write is roughly the speed at which people absorb

Slides are good for exposing, but goes through information too fast

Tell stories to back up what you are saying

Props
- Swinging pendulum experiment
- Can really engage the audidence and drive home a point

Slides
- There are too many slides and too many words (always)
- No logos, no titles, no bullets, no clutter
- 50pt font minimum
- We only have one language processor; read slides or listen to speaker -> choose one

Avoid anything that would cause you to turn your back to the audience

Stay in the centre, close to your slides if you have them

People are inspired by many things, but everyone is inspired when people exhibit passion about what they are doing

Inspire; Be passionate and show they why what they're learning is useful/interesting

It's better to get feedback from people who have no idea what you're doing than people who do

If you want to be remembered, you must have
- some symbol assiciated with your work
- some sort of slogan
- a surprise
- salient idea

story; how you did it, why it owrks, why it's important

Never have a questions slide; squanders real estate when it's up for 20 minutes

End with a contributions slide; what you and this talk have contributed to the world; whad your audience gets out of it

Tell a joke (at the end, not the begining); don't say thank you at the end; much better ways to end a talk; eg by saluteing the audience ("god bless america") lmao
