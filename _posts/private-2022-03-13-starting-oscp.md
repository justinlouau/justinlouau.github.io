This is something I've been meaning to start for a while now, ever since I completed the Privasec Hackelerator program. 

However, "getting an OSCP" is a somewhat nebulous and wishy washy goal, which was why I sat on it for so long.
Luckily, there's a wealth of resources for OSCP on the internet and I can study concurrently alongside my university study.

I don't really have a timeline for when I'm doing what and how long things take which is probably a bad thing, but I have a general idea of what I want to do. My goal is to be ready to take the OSCP by the end of this year. I'll work out the exact logistics of what qualities as "ready" and the where/how/when of taking the actual exam later, but I've compiled a basic learning pathway to follow, starting with getting context on penetration testing and then getting familar with the tools of the trade.

**Getting Context**
- TryHackMe PreSecurity & Junior Pen Tester
- CCNA Resources

**Getting Tools**
- Kali Linux Revealed Book
- Web App Security Handbook
- Metasploit Unleashed

We'll have to see how things go, but the plan is to work through these to establish some fundamentals, which I can then apply to CTFs and HackTheBoxs!
