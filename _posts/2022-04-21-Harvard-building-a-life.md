[HSB Building a Life - Howard H. Stevenson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLn28DrSF68)

What is success?
- hard to measure, different metric for differnent ppl

success is getting what you want, hapiness is wanting what you get

seized opportunities as they came up
lived life without regret

things go wrong, but if you acted honestly and on the best information it's hard to have regret

significance
- have you had a positive impact on ppl you care about

happy
- are you satisfied with your achievements

legacy
- have you done something that lasts

it's easy to make yourself miserable when you compare yourself to other people

who do you are about and what do you want to do for them?

keep different aspects of your life seperate - be multidimentional

don't wait to be happy - "I will be happy once I've got a hundred million dollars"

happiness in one aspect of your life won't make up for lackthereof in other aspects

it's not about balance - it's about juggling
- you have to keep your eye on all the balls; if you look at once you'll drop the others
- you have to give the balls energy; no sense in balancing the balls
- really just amounts to practice
- the most important ball in juggling is the falling ball; it's the one you're about to drop
- in life there are some rubber balls; careers tend to be fairly rubber - they'll bounce
- family is a little harder; sometimes if you drop that one it shatters

make friends early in life; shared experience and trauma is so important to relationships
make time 2-3 times a week, go have lunch/dinner with them

you have to seek out happiness on a regular basis; you don't postpone it

you can never be good at everything
"why did you go into the paper industry? I prefer to compete against dumb people then smart people"

what is enough?
- very interesting word in that it has both an upper and lower bound
- "have I done enough" / "that's enough"
- happy people have a reasoned sense of enough
- what are the dimentions of achievement that matter for you
- what are the time constraints? what's enough for today/this year/a lifetime
- most people need a sense of progress; even if you already have money you'll want more

treat aspects as contraints - eg. profit as a contraint - too little and unsustainable, too much and you're not reinvesting enough into your business and people

live life forwards - you can't change the past
