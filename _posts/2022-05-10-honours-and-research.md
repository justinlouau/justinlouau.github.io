I'm at that stage in my degree where I have a better idea of what the university and industry both have to offer, and I'm faced with the question of whether I should do an honours year

Pros:
- Can fit an extra internship into my degree
- Can take some more advanced courses and do some cool research
- Makes it easier to work overseas for visa/immigration purposes
- Opens up a pathway to a PhD if I want to do one later down the track

Cons:
- Opportunity cost of a year in industry (1 YOE, ~160k)
- Would have to defer/decline a return offer if I get one
- Research is hard

Another key concideration is whether I want to work in academia/get a PhD later down the track, or if I just want to go into industry. The main resource I've been looking at has been this article:

but this is something I would probably only know the answer to after I've done some research and gotten an idea of whether I enjoy it, which leads onto the next concideration:

#### Potential Thesis Topics

**Operating Systems**
- Quite enjoyed operating systems
- Can apply do a small scale taste of research project first in third year
- Trustworthy Systems guarantees a thesis to anyone with an HD in OS or AOS
- **Courses:** [Operating Systems](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/COMP3231), [Advanced Operating Systems](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/COMP9242), [Distributed Systems](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/COMP9243) 

**Formal Methods**
- Also offered by Trustworthy systems
- Very mathematical, have no experience - might try some of the courses before looking further
- **Courses:** [Algorithmic Verification](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/COMP3153), [Advanced Topics in Software Verification](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs4161/index.html)

**Algorithms**
- Seems pretty fun except when it's not
- Millennium problems
- Probably won't do unless something changes drastically - lots of interesting stuff going on though
- **Courses:** [Algorithms](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/COMP3121), [Advanced Algorithms](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/COMP4141), [Algorithms for Intractable Problems](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/COMP6741)

**Theory of Computation**
- Fundamentally about problem solving
- What can a computer do? halting problem
- **Resources:** [Why study ToC](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZh5kO3E9oC91ZSLYpiDtQw), [The amazing Alan Turing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bLCjMA0YlE), [Textbook](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Sipser_2006_Second_Edition_Problems.pdf)
- **Courses:** [Theory of Computation](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/COMP4141)

**Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning**
- I know nothing about this field
- UNSW doesn't have the best reputation for AI
- However, it is a emgerging field which will be super disruptive - will need to do some more research into this
- Might even concider going to USYD if it's for something like natural language processing

### Overall Thoughts

**Trustworthy Systems:** [Students](https://trustworthy.systems/students/) / [Theses](https://trustworthy.systems/students/theses) / [Research](https://trustworthy.systems/students/research)

I'm currently angling towards doing an Operating Systems thesis as I enjoyed taking OS, it's very practical, and has a security focus as well (sel4 is the world's only formally verified kernel). I particularly want to do a thesis with Trustworthy Systems because it's (in my opinion) one of the best research groups at UNSW and is actually doing something pretty cool and applicable.

Right now, the main concideration for me is probably if I get a return offer at the end of the year, although I can always come back and do an honours year later down the track. The main issue is needing to schedule my second/third year courses before then so I can save some level 4+ electives so that I don't die when I do end up doing honours.
