A few days after the Privasec Hackcelerator Program, I received an email from DroneSec to try out their ﻿Drone Security Course. DroneSec had given a guest lecture during the program, and so being able to take their security course was an unexpected bonus to the program.

The bundle came with three courses, covering Security, Regulations, and SecOps, as well as a submission attempt for their Drone Security Operations Certificate.

### The Course

The course itself was fairly straightforward - it consisted of self paced video lectures and resources covering drones and counter-drone systems, case studies of drone threats and incidents, and different methodologies for modelling, collecting, and using intelligence to mitgate risks. The course focused a lot on defence, covering how you would defend against malicious drones and some of the legal, intelligence, and forensics aspects of drone operations, which I think is particularly relevant to anyone working in the GRC side of security.

While I would have enjoyed a bit more of a foray into the technical side of drone security, the course was still very interesting and practical, particularly given it was entirely online. I think the main benefit I recieved was that it changed my perspective of how drones can be used as an attacker and opened up some interesting ideas about how drones can be a useful tool used to attack or defend an objective.

One of the things I think is great about security is how often you can have your perspective challenged, and this course definitely did that for me. Being able to apply a traditional security mindset to a new area is quite a fun exercise, and there are many real world case studies included in the course to ground what you can use a drone to do. In additional, having access to past DroneSec Notify intelligence reports was also really helpful to see how a professional company compiles and presents intelligence to clients and to draw connections between real world events and drone incidents.

On a more practical side, learning techniques on how to perform OSINT and conduct threat modelling was probably the most useful and immediately applicable part of the course for me. Small things like setting up Google Alerts for keywords of interest and creating threat profiles for use in threat assessments are useful to anyone, and a great way to practice research skills as well as gain a better understanding of the current intelligence landscape.

### Summary

Overall, I really enjoyed the course and think it offers some interesting insights into a bit of a niche area of security that not often thought about. While this course won't give you the knowledge on the more offensive aspects of hacking drones, it's still a very solid introduction to thinking about security and threat modelling from the perspective of drones.
