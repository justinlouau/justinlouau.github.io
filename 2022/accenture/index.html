With guidance from the mentors, we created a Figma prototype and React MVP.</p> <p><br /></p> <hr /> <h2 id="retro">Retro</h2> <p>At the end of the bootcamp, Jess helped us to conduct a retrospective (retro) to reflect on what we did well, what could have been done better, what has gone wrong, what are hte action items.

One of the more surprising takeaways from one of the senior developers was to be able to think about problems not just from a development perspective, but also a business impact perspective. Crucially, we needed to be able to justify the business impact of our project and be able to quantify it’s specific effects on revenue and productivity, which was very different to the usual engineering approach of “how best to solve this problem”.</p> <p>I think my favourite part of the bootcamp was the retro (retrospective), because it was a great chance to see the effects of our work and progress. I also really enjoyed hearing the perspectives of our mentors and others on our teams, since we all had shared and diverging views on different aspects of what we did and didn’t do well, which was really interesting. All in all, I felt a lot closer to my team by the end and it definately felt like we had all been through a shared ordeal as all group projects are, albeit this one positive and voluntary.</p> <p>I also surprisingly enjoyed contributing to the project from more of a project management role. I haven’t reeally concidered it before, but I think product management and SCRUM master work also seems pretty cool, which might be something I explore later. It’s definately a very interesting application of problem solving and resource management of how to divide work in a way that maximises happiness and also gets the job done. It was unexpectedly fun being on top of everything and having a strong contribution to the direction of the project as opposed to working on the technical details of what framework to use and where a searchbar should be positioned.</p> <p>In the end, would I work at Accenture? I don’t know, maybe early career. I can definately see a lot of the benefits of working at such a large consulting company - getting exposed to a broad range of projects and working many roles on lots of different teams would be super helpful to developing teamwork and time management skills. In the end, I suppose there will always be trade offs for every company, and I’m in a really lucky position to have been able to talk to people in the company and see firsthand what sort of work and culture there is. Luckily, I don’t graduate until 2023, so I won’t have to make a decision for a while and I can keep exploring and learning. The bootcamp was definately a great experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone else who’s thinking of applying.</p> <p><br /></p> <hr /> <h2 id="our-final-presentation">Our Final Presentation</h2> <div style="text-align: center"> <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTLJsdO98ZIK3Tv1nLGNgcLoeIL9yrOk5BRyGRPySNkrRWwKVGH91eXsLu2OUL5CWHW0_Pf4ts9k-MW/embed?" frameborder="0" width="600" height="400" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe> </div> </div> </article> <!-- <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <small class="block">&copy; 2022 Justin Lou &middot; &lt;/&gt; Powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://github.com/heiswayi/thinkspace">Thinkspace theme</a></small> </div> </footer> --> </main> <script type="text/javascript"> var _gaq = _gaq || []; _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'G-8GM5TPVTHV']); _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']); (function() { var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true; ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
