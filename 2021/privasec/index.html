It’s been great fun, and an amazing experience to get to see what real life hackers do in the day to day.</p> <p>There were two streams for this program this year - RED and GRC. I was in the RED stream, which focused on penetration testing, red teaming, and was the more “technical” of the two streams. We also had some shared sessions with the GRC stream, which focused on the governance, risk, and compliance aspects of security consulting. On top of the mentoring we got from the weekly sessions, we were able to try out both a malware security project and a web security project to get a taste of the field.</p> <p>I do have a bunch of notes and screenshots on the major and minor projects I did, but I didn’t document early on with the intention of doing a blog post, so compiling those into an organised writeup is more than I’m willing to do right now. However, we did had chance to present an informal presentation to the other mentees and mentors about what we had learned at the end of the program:</p> <p><br /></p> <div style="text-align: center"> <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQs-Km0nPnuDBLYi_oUSIf-KZtOAXAS9Vet2a-eMI927CzAg38_16gsiuvJmZQakwyYChTtqUWhPhE_/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="600" height="400" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe> </div> <p><br /></p> <p>Overall, the program was a lot of fun, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in security. My only regret was that I couldn’t commit more time to it because there was a lot of overlap with my coursework, but it was still a very good learning experience nonetheless.</p> <p>If I could redo the program, I would also definitely make more use of the mentors - finding the right questions to ask is actually pretty hard when you don’t know what you don’t know, and security is a field that requires a lot of independant learning. While I was able to do (in my opinion) decently well as a first year, I also saw from the other mentees that having good time management and technical maturity helped drastically.</p> <p>That being said, the mentors were amazing and the culture at Privasec is top notch. It’s definately a place I would be happy to work a bit later on, and I plan on applying to their graduate program once I graduate.</p> </div> </article> <!-- <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <small class="block">&copy; 2022 Justin Lou &middot; &lt;/&gt; Powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://github.com/heiswayi/thinkspace">Thinkspace theme</a></small> </div> </footer> --> </main> <script type="text/javascript"> var _gaq = _gaq || []; _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'G-8GM5TPVTHV']); _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']); (function() { var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true; ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
